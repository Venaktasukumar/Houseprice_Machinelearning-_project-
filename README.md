#Approach
1.importig librarries
2.read the dataset after uploading using pandas
3.data preprocessing(check whether any missing values,normalization and some other techniques to get better accuracy)
4.using the linear regression algorithm for the cleaned data
5.using train test split function we split the data into train and test data 
6.evaluating using test data(i.e splitted from original data)
7.by using score function we can find the accuracy
8.we can improve the accuracy by taking the better features without correlation
